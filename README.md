# Ruby Sample Code for the Cybersource Rest client API

This repository contains working code samples which demonstrate Ruby integration with the cybersource-rest-client-ruby and cybersource-rest-auth-ruby

The samples are organized into categories and common usage examples.


## Using the Sample Code

The samples are all completely independent and self-contained. You can analyze them to get an understanding of how a particular method works, or you can use the snippets as a starting point for your own project.

You can also run each sample directly from the command line.

## Running the Samples From the Command Line
* Clone this repository:
```
    $ git clone https://github.com/khaaldrogo/cybersource-rest-samples-ruby
```
* Install the cybersource-rest-client-ruby
```
    $ gem install 
```
* Run the individual samples by name. For example: 
```
    $ Ruby [DirectoryPath]\[CodeSampleName]
```
e.g.
```
    $ Ruby Samples\Payments\CoreServices\CapturePayment.rb
```
